              However, due to the nature of the products we implore you to kindly refer to the below-mentioned policy before

            <p>
              While we want to ensure you are satisfied with your purchase, we cannot guarantee that each request for return/refund 
              and/or exchange will be accepted by us. We reserve the right to refuse and/or deny any such request if it is not 
              aligned with the below-mentioned conditions.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Eligibility</h3>
            <p>
              Returns or exchanges are only accepted if your order is damaged during transit or if you received an incorrect product. 
              Note - The Customer acknowledges and agrees that, due to the nature of the products, the Company requires videographic 
              proof to process any return or exchange request. This videographic evidence is mandatory for the Company to internally 
              evaluate the condition of the product and make an informed decision regarding the return or exchange request. Failure 
              to provide such proof, as requested, will render the Company unable to process the return or exchange request. The 
              Customer agrees that the submission of the required video is a prerequisite for the consideration of any return or 
              exchange, and without it, no further action will be taken by the Company.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Timeframe</h3>
            <p>
              Requests for a refund or exchange must be made within seven (07) days of receiving your product. The item must be 
              returned in its original condition with its original certification and packaging intact. Any tampering with the product 
              and/or its certifications will be cause enough for us to deny your return request.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Exclusions</h3>
            <p>
              Returns and exchanges will not be accepted after the 7-day period. We at Mens Jewels take utmost pride in serving the 
              best products; however, should you have any doubts regarding the quality of the product, we implore you to kindly get 
              the product verified for authenticity at a Government gemological institute (ISO certified or internationally reputed). 
              If any gemstone is proven to be synthetic or artificial by such an institute, you are entitled to a 100% refund, return, 
              or exchange, as you deem fit.
